# BillionsOfPossibilities
Simple Fun Gambling Game developed to learn JFrame functionality as well as because I was bored and wanted to make a fun project.
Essentially, each person can pick a location which cooresponds to a pixel locaiton on screen.
When running the game, a line will rappidly be drawn on the screen jumping in random directions making a mesmerizing visual.
At each ne location, players can see how far the current line is from the location that they picked.
Whoever's point gets landed on first wins!
You additionally choose the size of the window/game you want, a larger window means less likely to win.

**Future Development**:
 - The idea would be you can gamble money on it landing on your point
 - Every Line drawn is a certain amount of money, you watch your money go down and can quit at any point, but wait, maybe the next one will be it...
 - Could also work with an online group, after a certain amount of time, the people who's points get the closest get rewarde based on how close
